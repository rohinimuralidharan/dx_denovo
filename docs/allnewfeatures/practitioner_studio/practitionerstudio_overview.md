# Practitioner Studio

Practitioner Studio is a newly designed user experience for HCL Digital Experience. Please see the following pages to understand how the new navigation is organized.

**Note:** With HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Container Update CF192 and later, the following issues are experienced with use of the Safari web browser \(Version 13.0.5 \(15608.5.11\). These issues, which were found in **Web Content** from the Practitioner Studio side navigator, will be resolved in a later software update:

-   List navigation is not accessible using keyboard
-   Incorrect focus behavior in **Open Search** and **Close** sidebar buttons
-   Remnant of highlight outline of **Search** icon remains after back-tabbing to **Back** link

## Overview

Practitioner Studio is a newly designed user experience for HCL Digital Experience.

There are several advantages to this new look. The consolidated navigation has a consistent look and feel for most administration tasks so that commonly used tasks are found together. User assistance is easily found and is provided for pages that are in the navigation.

In time, this interface also serves as the launching point for newly developed features.

Enabling Practitioner Studio deactivates the legacy Administration and Applications pages. However, all of these functions are still available.
