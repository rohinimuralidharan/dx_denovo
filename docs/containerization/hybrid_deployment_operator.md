# Hybrid deployment - Operator \| HCL Digital Experience

This section describes how to install HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Portal Server and Web Content Manager services to on-premises platforms, operating with Digital Asset Management, Content Composer, Experience API deployed to cloud-based Kubernetes and OpenShift platforms deployed using the Operator \(dxctl\) method.

## Overview

Many organizations are using cloud and containerized deployments as part of their overall systems environments. In parallel, organizations continue to operate software applications and processes on-premises. The HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Hybrid deployment reference architecture and topics describe an approach to deploy and manage HCL Digital Experience 9.5 core Portal Server and Web Content Manager services on premises, and connect to cloud native components Digital Asset Management, Content Composer, Experience API and related services in a production environment.

**Notes:**

-   The hybrid deployment of cloud-based components HCL Digital Asset Management, Content Composer, and Experience API is supported on Red Hat OpenShift with the HCL DX 9.5 CF19 release. It is not yet supported with an on-premises clustered environment. The HCL DX hybrid deployment model will be supported on additional Kubernetes platforms in later release updates.
-   Virtual Portal support with Content Composer is not yet supported. Support for this component in a virtual portal deployment model will be available in later releases.

                        deployment")

## Prerequisites

-   HCL Digital Experience V9.5 CF19 or higher is deployed to supported on-premises platforms, in a standalone, cluster, or farm topology. See the [Roadmaps to deploy your Digital Experience 9.5 system](../../9.5/install/deployment_patterns.html) topic for more information.
-   Practitioner Studio has been enabled in the Digital Experience 9.5 CF19 or higher installation. See the [How to enable Practitioner Studio](../../9.5/practitioner_studio/enable_prac_studio.html) topic for instructions.
-   A common domain, using an SSL connection, is established for both the on premise HCL DX 9.5 CF19 and higher on-premises environment, and the target Red Hat Open Shift platform deployment to contain cloud native components HCL DX Experience API, Digital Asset Management and Content Composer. For example, mytargetcloud.dx.com and myonprem.dx.com would have the same domain: dx.com.
-   Single sign-on must be enabled on HCL DX 9.5 CF19 or higher on-premises environment. On DMGR or WAS Admin console under **Security** \> **Global Security** \> **Web & SIP Security** \> **Single Sign-On**, **Enabled** is checked and **Domain name** is set to common domain. For example, dx.com.
-   A high-performance network connection is established between the HCL DX 9.5 CF19 and higher on-premises environment, and the target DX Red Hat Open Shift platform deployment.
-   dxctl tool.
-   **Volume Requirement**: Requires an AccessMode of ReadWriteMany. Reference the [Storage Class and Volume](../../9.5/containerization/sample_storage_class_volume.html) topic for more information.

Ensure you have obtained a backup of the HCL DX 9.5 on-premises deployment. See the [Backup and Restore](../admin-system/i_wadm_c_bkup_restr_winlinux.html) topic for additional information.

## Enabling Hybrid Deployment support in the HCL Digital Experience 9.5 on-premises environment

Follow the steps below to enable Hybrid deployment support in the HCL Digital Experience 9.5 on-premises environment.

1.  Access the latest HCL DX 9.5 CF19 or higher release software from the [HCL Software License Portal](https://hclsoftware.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operationsportal/logon.do).

    The package will include the file hcl-dx-cloud-scripts, which should be downloaded and extracted to your local system. This will present the following deploy, dxctl and scripts directories as shown below:

    ![Download and configure the DXCTL tool](../assets/Download_and_configure_DXCTL_tool.png)

2.  Configure Properties of the dxctl tool.

    Navigate to the dxctl/properties directory and open the hybrid-deployment.properties file in your favorite editor.

    ![Configure Properties of the DXCTL tool](../assets/Configure_DXCTL_tool_Properties.png)

    Sample properties for deploying Digital Asset Management, Content Composer, and the Experience API for use with an on-premise DX environment are shown below. Use following example to modify the values in the dxctl/properties/hybrid-deployment.properties file to reflect your target Red Hat Open Shift environment to deploy the Content Composer, Digital Asset Management, and the Experience API components.

    **Note:** For a Hybrid deployment, the following items should be enabled and/or not included in the deployment:

    -   **Enable**

        `api.enabled(eAPI), composer.enabled(Content Composer)` and/or `dam.enabled(DAM)` to true.

    -   **Not included**

        **`**dx.tag**`**

        This is not required for a hybrid deployment as DX Portal and WCM is installed on premises.

        **`**dx.database**`**

        This is not required for a hybrid deployment as it is installed with DX Portal and WCM on premises.

    See the *Reference list* below for explanations of the file items.

    If the **Web Content** and **Digital Assets** menu items do not appear in the menu selections, follow the steps below to enable Content Composer and Digital Asset Management using the Configuration Engine.


## Enable Content Composer and Digital Asset Management

1.  Locate the Content Composer and Digital Asset Management URLs.

    The URLs will match the location values of the Red Hat OpenShift route of the component.

    Copy the Content Composer and Digital Asset Management URL from the Red Hat OpenShift dashboard console and add the suffix/static as in the example below:

    ![Locate the Content Composer and Digital Asset Management URLs](../assets/Locate_Content_Composer_and_Digital_Asset_Management_URLs.png)

    -   **Content Composer – Content UI URL Example**: https://dx-hybrid-service-dxhybwin-dxhybwin.apps.comp-dxdev.hcl-dx-dev.net/dx/ui/content/static
    -   **Digital Asset Management UI URL Example**: https://dx-hybrid-service-dxhybwin-dxhybwin.apps.comp-dxdev.hcl-dx-dev.net/dx/ui/dam/static
2.  Navigate to the ConfigEngine service.

    Connect/login to the HCL DX 9.5 on-premises system and open a command line prompt. Navigate to the following path on your deployment:

    ```
    C:\> cd  <path to wp_profile>\ConfigEngine
    ```

3.  Enable Content Composer and Digital Asset Management to the Hybrid deployment.

    If the on-premises HCL DX 9.5 Portal and Web Content Manager deployment is installed to a Windows platform, execute:

    -   **Enable Content Composer**:

        ```
        <Path to wp_profile>\ConfigEngine\ConfigEngine.bat enable-headless-content -Dstatic.ui.url=CONTENT_UI_URL -DWasPassword=... -DPortalAdminPwd=...
        ```

        **Note:** In the command above, the CONTENT\_UI\_URL=Route URL is copied from the Red Hat OpenShift dashboard with `/static`.  `-DWasPassword=type` is the IBM WebSphere Application Server password and `-DPortalAdminPwd=type` is the DX admin password.

    -   **Enable Digital Asset Management**:

        ```
        <Path to wp_profile>\ConfigEngine\ConfigEngine.bat enable-media-library -Dstatic.ui.url=DAM_URL -DWasPassword=... -DPortalAdminPwd=...
        ```

        **Note:** In the command above, the DAM\_URL=Route URL is copied from the Red Hat OpenShift dashboard with `/static`. `-DWasPassword=type` is the IBM WebSphere Application Server password and `-DPortalAdminPwd=type` is the DX admin password.

    If the on-premises HCL DX 9.5 Portal and Web Content Manager deployment is installed to a Linux platform, execute:

    -   **Enable Content Composer**:

        ```
        <Path to wp_profile>\ConfigEngine\ConfigEngine.sh enable-headless-content -Dstatic.ui.url=CONTENT_UI_URL -DWasPassword=... -DPortalAdminPwd=...
        ```

        **Note:** In the command above, the CONTENT\_UI\_URL=Route URL is copied from the Red Hat OpenShift dashboard with `/static`.  `-DWasPassword=type` is the IBM WebSphere Application Server password and `-DPortalAdminPwd=type` is the DX admin password.

    -   **Enable Digital Asset Management**:

        ```
        <Path to wp_profile>\ConfigEngine\ConfigEngine.sh enable-media-library -Dstatic.ui.url=DAM_URL -DWasPassword=... -DPortalAdminPwd=...
        ```

        **Note:** In the command above, the DAM\_URL=Route URL is copied from the Red Hat OpenShift dashboard with `/static`. `-DWasPassword=type` is the IBM WebSphere Application Server password and `-DPortalAdminPwd=type` is the DX admin password.

    Once the above steps are completed, log in to the Digital Experience 9.5 deployment and validate the Web Content and Digital Assets menu items appear.
