# Containerization overview

Learn more about the containerization architecture, including the supported container platforms in deploying HCL Digital Experience images for your environment.

## Overview

HCL introduced full support for containerization in Digital Experience \(DX\) 9.5. HCL Digital Experience users can deploy HCL Digital Experience images in Docker, Red Hat OpenShift 4.1 and higher, also Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \(EKS\), Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service \(AKS\) and Google Kubernetes Engine \(GKE\) for test, development, staging, and production environments. See the [Digital Experience on containerized platforms](deployment.md) topic for the latest information on supported platforms and container packages.

Whether developing, testing, or running a full production environment, use of Docker images and containers are preferred for the ease of deploying applications, including the latest version of HCL Digital Experience. Deploy in a fraction of the time it takes compared to traditional deployment models.
