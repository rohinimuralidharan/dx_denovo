-   What is the operating system?
-   What is the exact command used to start \(or attempt to start\) the container?

|Issue|Solution|
|-----|--------|
|-   Out of memory

|Ensure that the memory request and the limit defined in the custom resource are high enough for the specified heap size in the Portal configuration|
|-   DX pod will not start
-   Unschedulable pods
-   Pod has unbound immediate `PersistentVolumeClaims`

|Ensure that the specified volume exists, and meets the deployment requirements. To reuse a volume, see the [Delete](openshift.md#uicontrol_t1m_t4m_yjb) topic.|
