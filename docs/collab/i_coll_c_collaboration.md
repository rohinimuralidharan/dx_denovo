# HCL Sametime

The HCL Sametime portlets are provided with HCL Digital Experience offerings and can be used by customers with entitlements to HCL Sametime Complete or Sametime Communicate V9.

The Sametime Web 2.0 Contact List portlet is available from the **Applications** \> **Collaboration** area of the HCL DX site.

## People awareness

Users can view contact and other typical business card information for a registered user by displaying the Person card. The Person card is available through a wide range of portal components including HCL Domino® and Sametime® integration, personalization, and web content authoring. To view the Person card, move the cursor over an active \(underlined\) person's name and then select **Click** for **Person Card**.

When Sametime Communicate or Complete is enabled in your portal configuration, users can work with the complete set of people awareness functionality, which includes instant messaging and application sharing through e-meetings. Person names appear aware - with a dynamic online status indicator. Click **Profile** to display full information about the person. Additional actions can include:

-   **Send Mail**
-   **Chat**
-   **Add as Sametime Contact**

If you choose not to enable Sametime in your portal configuration, people awareness functionality is more limited. People's names appear as hyperlinks, but with no people awareness icon next to each name, and available actions on the Person Card are limited to those that are native to HCL Digital Experience.
