# Troubleshooting: Remove a WebSphere Portal profile

View troubleshooting information for creating a HCL Portal profile.

Each potential step in the configuration is included. Because the steps vary depending on your selections, the steps are not numbered. Find the step that failed to learn more about correcting and recovering from the failure. If you need to change a value that you entered in the wizard, then you must run the configuration again.

**Tip:** If you must go through the wizard again, download the wizard selections that you made to save time. Then, cancel the configuration. Start the process over and upload your saved selections. Correct or enter values for the parameters that caused the failure.

|Clean up step|1.  Use the manageprofiles command to remove the profile.

The command file is in the app\_server\_root/bin directory. The command file is a script that is named manageprofiles.sh\|bat.

Example:

    ```
 /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/bin/manageprofiles.sh -delete 
 -profileName profile\_name
    ```

2.  Manually delete the profile directory only if the `manageprofiles -delete` command completes successfully.

The manageprofiles command creates a log for every profile that it creates, deletes, or augments. If the `manageprofiles -delete` command does not complete successfully, review the logs that are named profile\_name\_create.log and profile\_name\_augment.log in install\_root/logs/manageprofiles.
