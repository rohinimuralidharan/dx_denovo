## New HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Release Artifacts supporting CICD release processes

The HCL Digital Experience 9.5 DXClient and DXConnect servlet provides developers and administrators an approach to deploy changes or improvements to the HCL Digital Experience platform, and to automate processes in the development and delivery process. Updates include process definitions to automate select IBM WebSphere Application Server settings during deployment, generate import and export lists of virtual portals, and import and export personalization rules.

See the [DXClient and DXConnect tooling supporting CICD release processes](../containerization/deploy_dx_components_using_hcl_dx_client_and_dx_connect.md) topic for more information.

## New HCL Digital Experience Site Manager Custom Layout Editor

Beginning with HCL Digital Experience CF198, a Custom Layout Editor is available for use with HCL DX Site Manager capabilities, reducing custom development requirements for site designers implementing custom layouts in DX site pages.

See the [Using the Digital Experience Custom Layout Editor](../../8.5/panel_help/custom_layout_editor.html) topic for more information.

## New Experience APIs

New HCL Experience Web Content Manager REST APIs are available for new menu component update, collection responses conversion utilities, the ability to use the page editor to edit elements inline and update metadata, set locations for sites, set HTML tags for text elements, and more.

See the [HCL DX Experience API](../open_api/openapi_overview.md) topic for more information

## Rationalized CF release versioning

Beginning with HCL Digital Experience CF196, single versioning is used for both container and on-premise Combined Cumulative Fixes \(CFs\). This means that fixes for both deployments are included into one CF deliverable. And although the versioning is the same, CFs are packaged separately for on-premises and container deployments.

See the [CF release versioning and update path](../install/rm_cf.md#cf_release_versioning_update) topic for more information.
