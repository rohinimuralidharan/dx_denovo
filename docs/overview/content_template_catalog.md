# Content Template Catalog

The content template catalog is a set of templates that you can use to accelerate building a website. Using these templates you can build a basic site quickly with little or no customization.

The content template catalog is a comprehensive set of templates, pre-configured portlets, content-oriented theme, and layouts. Use the palette of pre-configured portlets to drop components on your pages for navigation, teasers, slide shows, carousels, and more. The template pattern supports the creation of your own templates. A page created from a template can be modified and then turned into a new template. You could build up you own custom template library and provide a self-service site development offering to your users.
