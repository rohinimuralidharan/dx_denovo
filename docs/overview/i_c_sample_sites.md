# Streamlined site creation

You can use the Site Builder to generate your own portal site.

## Creating portal sites on demand

Use the Site Builder to generate your own site —— without needing any portal development skills or assistance from an administrator. Select a template from the available samples, choose the look that you want, and then allow the Site Builder do the rest.

The Site Builder automatically creates sites as virtual portals; however, administrators and developers can extend the wizard to create any type of portal site. Portal developers can also enhance the Site Builder by creating custom templates, and then adding them to the Site Builder.

Download the Site Builder. Package contents include the portlet .war \(web application archive\) file, supporting files and directories, and detailed instructions in a .pdf file. After you deploy the Site Builder, you must add the portlet to a page that users can access. For more information, read the .pdf file that comes with the Site Builder.
