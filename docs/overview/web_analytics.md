# Web analytics

HCL Digital Experience \(DX\) includes a number of solutions to help you understand how visitors use your site, including server-side analytics and client-side analytics. Client-side analytics is also called active site analytics.

With HCL DX analytics you can achieve the following goals:

-   Measure the success of your DX site.
-   Predict the demand to a DX site in the future.
-   Plan for changing site visitor needs.

## Active site analytics

Through active site analytics \(client-side\) HCL Portal makes it easier to collect, process, and report on your site usage. Integration with leading web analytics products is easy. For example, after web analytics solutions are integrated to your DX platform, DX active site analytics enable page view tag results from third-party analytics packages to assess results from pages on your site. Examples of web analytics tools to integrate with can include HCL Unica, IBM Digital Analytics, Webtrends, and others.

Active site analytics:

-   Captures visitor behavior data directly from the web browser to ensure that every action is recorded.
-   Dynamically accommodates all content changes to the site so adding a page, product, or category typically requires no tag maintenance.
-   Creates a comprehensive record of visitor interactions and clients also do not have to pre-define segments, visitor events, campaigns, or categories for analysis.

Active site analytics uses a flexible, backend business logic instead of hardcoding the logic into the site instrumentation. As a result, you enjoy reduced IT maintenance and maximum analytical flexibility.

You can analyze web analytics reports in context, without switching to an external tool. This capability is called overlay reports. Overlay reports provide a quick look at the success of a page, portlet, or web content. Overlay reports are immediately available for IBM Digital Analytics \(formerly known as Coremetrics\), but you can extend that capability to other analytics tools.

## Server-side analytics

Using server-side analytics, you can gather information about page and site visitor management activities, site visitor page and portlet requests, and session activities. Page and visitor management activities include creating, reading, updating, and deleting. Session activities include login, logout, timeouts, and login failures.
