# HCL Connections

Integrate HCL Connections into your site by using community pages, search integration, and more.

## Community pages

Portlets on community pages are automatically scoped to the community membership and display content from the community in the portlets. For example, if your community contains a forum you can add the forum portlet to a community page. The portal site visitors can view and interact with the forum content from the portal site.

You can automatically create new communities for your pages during the page template instantiation.

## Search integration

Integrating HCL Connections content into your portal search makes it easier for site visitors to find community content. Visitors can search for a term and see results from your portal site and HCL Connections. Each HCL Connections component has a unique seedlist provider. To configure your portal search to include HCL Connections content, you must configure a content source for each seedlist. Instructions are provided in the HCL Connections product documentation.

## Tag integration

You can configure you portal tag cloud to include tags from HCL Connections. This configuration makes it easier for your site users to find content in the communities.

You can also add the HCL Connections Tags Portlet to a page. Then, you can wire it to other HCL Connections portlets. Then, site visitors can use tags to find community content faster in blogs, wikis, and more.

## Profiles integration

You can configure your portal site to show HCL Connections Business Card information. Names that are associated with HCL Connections profiles display as active links. Your site visitors click the name to see the business card. From the business card visitors can link to communities, blogs, and more for the selected user.

## Files integration

Content authors can easily create links to files stored on HCL Connections. From the rich text editor, in HCL Web Content Manager, the author can browse Files. Authors can also use Web Content Manager markup generation to render the current contents of specific HCL Connections Folders.

Integration with HCL Connections Files is based on the generic Content Management Interoperability Services \(CMIS\).
