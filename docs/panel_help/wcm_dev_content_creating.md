# Creating content items

Content items are based on authoring templates. The fields that are displayed in a content item form can be hidden from different users, so not all of the following steps might be required. Some fields and elements might already contain default data.

1.  To create a content item, open the applications menu and go to **Content** \> **Web Content Management**, click **New** \> **Content**, and then select an authoring template. The content form is opened.
