# Creating a WAR-based theme copy

With a WAR-based theme, you deploy both static and dynamic content as an EAR file. You can easily deploy your theme to your Portal server when your static and dynamic contents are contained in a single EAR file. Use this option when your theme is ready for production.

**Note:** When you update any theme content, you must update the WAR file and redeploy it to the server.
